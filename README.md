This is about to create azure resources using terraform HCL
In this repo contains files main.tf, variables.tf, output.tf
In variables.tf we used to declare varaibles for resource which helps in dynamic creation of the azure resources
In main.tf we newly create a resource group and the location for resource 
In output.tf we store values  of resource group id and resource group name after creation of the resource group

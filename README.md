This is about to create azure resources using terraform HCL.
In this repo contains files main.tf, variables.tf, output.tf.
In variables.tf we used to declare varaibles for resource which helps in dynamic creation of the azure resources.
In main.tf we newly create a resource group and the location for resource.
In output.tf we store values  of resource group id and resource group name after creation of the resource group.
